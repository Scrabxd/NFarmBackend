## NFARM BACKEND ## 

The creation of this Backend was done with,NODE JS using TypeScript, Express, Bcrypt and Sequelize in a PSQL schema.

```
npm i
```

To start the project.

To run the project, you must have a .ENV file, with the port on it that would be:

```
PORT = 4000/3000/2000
```

And your configurations for the data base, I'm using Railway so my configs looks like this:

```
PGDATABASE
PGHOST
PGPASSWORD  
PGPORT
PGUSER
```

And the addition of an apiToken

```
ApiKey
```
